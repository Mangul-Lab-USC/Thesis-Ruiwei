[Acknowledgements]

First and foremost, I would like to greatly acknowledge the help and support of my supervisor, Dr. Serghei Mangul, who has offered me valuable suggestions in academic studies and provided me with valuable guidance in every stage of the writing of this thesis. 
Also, I shall extend my gratitude to my teamates and friends in Serghei's lab, thanks for their help, kindness and time spent together. Without Dr. Sergheiâ€™s enlightening instruction, and my teamates' help, I would not have completed my thesis.

[Background information]

Modern data-driven research increasingly depends on quantitative analysis and researchers have increasingly recognized the need and benefits of sharing research products (i.e. raw data, the metadata accompanying the raw data, and the code of the analysis). To promote transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research, it is not only necessary to publish a full description of the study design, methodology, results, and interpretation, but it is also critical to make all research products publicly available, shareable, repurposable and properly documented.

Currently, the conduct of sharing research products relies heavily on individual researchers, and the regulations of data sharing are enforced by these individuals and research institutions in a variety of ways. However, a rising body of evidence in recent years reveals reproducibility issues across many scientific disciplines, i.e. published results frequently contain studies that cannot be duplicated due to a lack of documentation, code, data or metadata. 

This study analyzed 480 publications across eight journals from 2016 to 2021 to quantify code and data availability of the publications and assess the completeness of the metadata reported in publications and online repositories across 127 studies over 18,559 samples across six therapeutic fields. The results indicate that only 17% of the scientific manuscripts published in prominent biomedical journals share raw data and 31% of the papers share code and the overall completeness of  the metadata in original publication is 71.8% and in public repositories is 48.6%. This research aims to analyze the availability of research products and help to build a transparent, reproducible data-driven environment in biomedical research.

[How to use this code]

There are three chapters in my thesis,
which are Availability of data accompanying scientific publication, 
Availability of code accompanying scientific publication 
and Metadata availability and analysis. 
The code in chapter 1 was put in the file named "chapter 1-data availability", 
the code in chapter 2 was put in the file named "chapter 2-code availability", 
and the code in chapter 3 was put in the file named "chapter 3-metadata".
The data in chapter 1 and 2 can be found the file named "Data_CDAP_Jan22-Main_copy1".
The data in chapter 3 can be found in the file named "Metadata_Summary_Table".
